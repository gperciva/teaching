<h2>Exercise 11: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
This lab combines everything we've done so far.  If you didn't
understand any of the previous exercises, you may want to ask
questions about them before beginning this one!

<p>
Nothing new.

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Write a tic-tac-toe game (also known as "noughts and crosses",
"tick tack toe", "X's and O's").  If you're not familiar with the
game, see <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Wikipedia's page
on tic-tac-toe</a>, or ask a lab instructor.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Use your "game board" from exercise 10.  The same constraints
apply, namely:

<ul>
<li>
You <em>must</em> use a two-dimensional array to represent the
game board in memory.

</li><li>
You <em>must</em> create formulae to deal with "number &lt;=&gt;
row and column".  You <em>may not</em> use <code>if</code>
statements or a <code>switch...case</code> statement.  You can use
those commands elsewhere in the assignment.

</li>
</ul>


</li><li>
Modify your "print the game board" function to print out
<code>.XO</code> as required.

</li><li>
Your game should be human-vs-computer, and human moves first.

</li><li>
Computer moves randomly.  Note that it must select an unoccupied
square; you cannot simply pick a number from 1-9 at random without
checking!

</li><li>
Before each player takes a move, print out the current game board.
You can remove board from the screen by doing
<code>printf("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");</code> 2 or 3 times.

</li><li>
After each player takes a move, you must check to see if anybody
won the game.

<p>
(hint: write a function that checks if player X won the game, then
call this function twice, for player 1 and player 2)
<br>
(another hint: there are 8 possible winning combinations; a player
wins if one of 8 combinations of 3 square all have his mark.  You
can either write out all 8 combinations in full, or use three
<code>for</code> loops -- test the three vertical wins, three
horizontal wins, and two diagonal wins.)
<br>
(final hint: begin work on this point by changing the rules of the
game.  Pretend that you can only win by going horizontally or
diagonally across the middle.  Solve this problem first; once you
have it working for the "fake rules", just add in the other 6
winning combinations.)
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
(optional: instead of having the computer move randomly, try to
make it play intelligently.)

<h2>Exercise 12: Strings are Arrays of Characters</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
You may recall that in Lab 1, we defined strings variables
as:
</p>

<pre>
char animal[100] = "cat";
</pre>

<p>
As you may guess now, we were actually creating an array of
characters.
</p>

<br>

<p>
You may have noticed that we can print out a string without
needing to specify the total number of characters:
</p>

<pre>
char animal[100] = "ferocious kitten";
printf("The %s sleeps!", animal);
</pre>

<p>
The above code will print out
"<code>The&nbsp;ferocious&nbsp;kitten&nbsp;sleeps</code>", even
though the char array <code>animal</code> contains 100 chars.
This is because the final character is a special ascii-null character:
'<code>\0</code>' (added automatically by the compiler in this
case).
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Dealing with strings:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt; // extra include!

int main() {
    char animal[100] = "ferocious kitten";

    // length of the string
    int length = strlen(animal);

    int i;
    for (i=0; i&lt;length; i++) {
        printf("%c", animal[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<p>
We can also copy strings.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main ()
{
    char orig[100]= "Cats are awesome";
    char next[100];

    // 99 is the maximum number of chars
    strncpy(next,orig,99);

    printf("%s\n", next);
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
The Coleman-Liau Index test[1] is an easily-computable estimation of
the difficulty of reading some text.  It gives an approximate
"grade level" (in US school system: grade 1 is for students 5-6
years old, and the numbers increase linearly until grade 12).
</p>

<div class="warning">
In the above formula, "character" means "letter" -- for the
purposes of that formula, spaces and periods do not count as
characters.

<p>
Write a program that calculates the Coleman-Liau Index of some text.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Perform the actual calculation in a function which accepts
<code>char&nbsp;text[]</code> as input and returns the
Coleman-Liau grade level.

</li><li>
If the calculated grade is less than 1, set it to 1 instead of
returning a lower number.

</li><li>
You may assume that the text:

<ul>
<li>
begins with a word

</li><li>
ends with a period

</li><li>
contains no numbers or non-letters

</li><li>
there is one space between words, and one space after a period (other
than the final period).

</li><li>
each sentence ends with a period; no exclaimation marks or
question marks are used.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(hint: what is the relationship between the number of periods,
number of spaces, and the words+sentences in the text?)
<br>
(another hint: how can you count the number of periods and spaces
in the text?)
</p>
</li>

</li><li>
Test it with the following three exerpts.  For these definitions,
you <em>may ignore</em> the code style requirement that lines
should be less than 80 characters long.  When you cut&amp;paste
this into your <code>.c</code> file, you might need to ensure that
it all goes onto one line.

<ol>
<li>
<pre>
char text[100] = "I like cats. Cats like me. Miao miao miao. Dogs are
bad. Bad dogs bad.";
</pre>
(words of wisdom)

<br>
(hint: the above fragment has 70 characters, 51 letters, 15 words,
14 spaces, 5 periods, 5 sentences, and a calculated CLI of -5.6,
which we change to be grade 1.)

</li><li>
<pre>
char text[500] = "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this
petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And
all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out,
brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and
frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury Signifying nothing."
</pre>
(Macbeth: Act 5, Scene 5, lines 19-28)

</li><li>

<pre>
char text[1000] = "Existing computer programs that measure readability
are based largely upon subroutines which estimate number of syllables,
usually by counting vowels. The shortcoming in estimating syllables is
that it necessitates keypunching the prose into the computer. There is
no need to estimate syllables since word length in letters is a better
predictor of readability than word length in syllables. Therefore, a new
readability formula was computed that has for its predictors letters per
hundred words and sentences per hundred words. Both predictors can be
counted by an optical scanning device, and thus the formula makes it
economically feasible for an organization such as the US Office of
Education to calibrate the readability of all textbooks for the public
school system."
</pre>
(abstract of Coleman-Liau journal paper.)

</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
(optional: research and implement the Automated Readibility Index
(ARI).  Compare those results with the Coleman-Liau results.)
