<h2>Exercise 1: "Hello, world!" and friends</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
By convention, the first thing to learn in a new programming
language is to print the text "<code>Hello,&nbsp;world!</code>".
Although text isn't very exciting by itself, the ability to
output text is vital for debugging (fixing programs).
</p>

<p>
Most programming languages, including C, indicate text with
"double quotation marks": the first <code>"</code> indicates the
beginning of text.  The computer then treates everything until the
next <code>"</code> as text.
</p>

<p>
This causes problems if you want to print an actual " symbol in
the output.  For that reason, we use <em>escape sequences</em> to
represent symbols which are difficult (or impossible) to indicate
with plain text.
</p>

<p>
In addition to telling a compiler how to create an executable
file, source code should also tell future programmers why the code
does what it does.  If anything in the code is unclear, a
programmer should add <em>comments</em> which explain the
situation.  More information about comments is on the <a
href="../info/style.html">good programming style</a> page.

</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Printing text (complete example):
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");

    // wait for a keypress
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<p>
Selected <em>escape sequences</em>
(<a href="../info/constructs.html#esc_seq">more escape sequences</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Name</th></tr>
  <tr><td>\n</td><td>New line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\t</td><td>Horizontal tab</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\\</td><td>Back slash</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\'</td><td>Single quotation mark</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\"</td><td>Double quotation mark</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are two ways of adding comments (code exerpt):
</p>

<pre>
// this is a single-line comment
/* this type of comment can span multiple
   lines; everything is a comment until
   the
   computer sees the ending */
</pre>

</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Write a short self-introduction (not necessarily truthful!), and a
list of items you would buy if given 1, 10, 100, or 1000 pounds.
Example output:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Greetings!  I am \Sir Percival\ of the Round Table, hailing from
Vancouver, Canada.  My fair city lies approximately 4,500 miles to
the West.  In my country, we say `eh?' a lot.

Free money, you say?  Well, let's see...
        Pounds   Purchase
        1        A packet of tea biscuits.
        10       Second-hand DVDs of "Still Game", so I can learn Glasgow patter.
        100      An external hard drive for my laptop.
        1000     A visit to my family next Christmas.
</pre>

<p>
Your program should:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Print a message similar to the above example.

</li><li>
No line should be longer than 80 characters -- you will need to
use multiple <code>printf()</code> statements.

</li><li>
Use <em>all</em> these escape sequences: <code>\n \t \\ \'
\"</code>

</li><li>
Use <em>both</em> types of comments: <code>// /*...*/</code>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(optional: make it funny.  We'll like you more.  You won't get any
marks for being funny, but hey, you'll make a friend!  Looking at
first-year programming exercises gets <em>really</em> boring.)

<h2>Exercise 2: Variables and (simple) Math</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Computers would be boring if they didn't do any computation, and
variables make computation a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
Variables must be <em>declared</em> before you can use them.  This
tells the computer to reserve a piece of memory to store the
variable's value.
</p>

<p>
The computer doesn't care what you call the variable (within
reason -- see <a
href=../info/constructs.html#identifiers>identifier</a> for the exact
requirements), but having descriptive variable names will make
your programs much easier to work on.
</p>

<p>
For the next few weeks, we will use two types of numeric
variables: <code>int</code> (an integer), and <code>float</code>
(a floating-point, i.e. decimal, number).
</p>

<p>
There is another type of variable, which is very rarely used by
itself: <code>char</code>.  This represents one <em>ASCII</em>
character; each value (between <code>0</code> and
<code>127</code>) represents an entry in the <a
href="../info/ascii.html">ASCII table</a>.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Text variables are called <em>strings</em>, short for "a string of
characters".  Technically, they are stored as an <em>array</em> of
characters, but we will return to this in the second lab lab.
For now, we will not do any modifications of strings.
</p>

<p>
For reasons which we will discuss in a later lab, you can get an
array of a particular variable type by adding
<code>[</code><em>x</em><code>]</code> to the variable name, where
<em>x</em> is the number of variables.  For <em>other</em> reasons
which we will discuss later, a string's length must be <em>1
more</em> than the number of characters you want it to hold.
</p>

<div class="info">
To get a string of 99 characters (recommended), write:

<pre>
char&nbsp;string_variable[100];
</pre>

</div>

</div>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

Declaring and printing variables, and basic math:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int x;
    printf("x is currently %i", x);
    printf(", which is completely random!\n");
    printf("  (we probably don't want this)\n\n");
    x = 3;

    float y = 4.1;
    printf("y is currently %f.\n", y);
    printf("Make that shorter: %.2f.\n", y);
    printf("Make that longer: %.8f.\n\n", y);

    int z;
    z = x/y;
    z = x + z * y - y;
    printf("Why does z = %i?\n\n", z);

    printf("We can print multiple ");
    printf("variables: %i %f %i\n\n", x, y, z);

    char a = 71;
    printf("What about this one: %c\n", a);

    // wait for a keypress
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<div class="info">
Examine the above program carefully -- there is a
lot of good information in it!  Try changing the values of
variables, and examine the new output.
</div>

We can also declare and print strings.

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char name[100] = "Graham";
    printf("Hi there!  %s greets you!", name);

    // wait for a keypress
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<div class="warning">
For now we will only declare and print strings; we won't modify
them until the second lab.
</div>

</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Save your introduction/story program from Exercise 1 with a new
file name: we will be modifying it, but you don't want to lose all
your hard work.
</p>

<p>
Modify the new version of your introduction/story so that your program:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Declare at least one int.
</li><li>
Declare at least one float.
</li><li>
Declare at least one char[100].
</li><li>
Use some math to change the value of a variable.
</li><li>
Prints at least one int (not necessarily the first one you
declared).
</li><li>
Prints at least one float (not necessarily the first one you
declared).
</li><li>
Prints at least one string (exactly the one(s) you declared).
</li><li>
You may not use any numbers within the "double-quotes" of a
<code>printf</code> statement -- use variable substitution 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(hint: converting units is an easy way to get some math in there.
Change between miles + km, pounds + euros, pounds + kg, human
years + cat years, etc.  You may need to rewrite part of your
self-introduction to introduce some units.)
</p>

<div class="info">
Think about your variable names.  Don't write something like:

<pre>
distance = distance * 1.609344
</pre>

Instead, give them more descriptive names, like

<pre>
distance_km = distance_miles * 1.609344
</pre>

(<a href="../info/style.html">Read more about good style</a>)

some fancy symbols from the <a
href=../info/constructs.html#operators>table of operators</a> to
convert into them.)

<br style="clear:both"/>
<a name="keyboard-input">
<h2>Exercise 3: Keyboard input</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Reading numbers from the keyboard is fairly straightforward:
declare the variable (reserve space in memory), then read data
into that variable (the space in memory).
</p>

<p>
The <code>&amp;</code> symbol means "the location of memory
pointed to by the following variable".  Memory management in C is
not straightforward, so we postpone this discussing until a later
lab.  For now, just remember that you need this symbol in front of
a <em>numeric</em> variable in your <code>scanf</code> statement.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Reading text is not quite as simple as numbers.  As discussed in
Exercise 2, we must tell the computer the maximum number of
characters.  This maximum value must be passed to the
<code>scanf</code> function with <code>"%99s"</code>.
</p>

<div class="warning">
Specifying the maximum size of keyboard input is
<em>critically</em> important.  Failure to specify the maximum
size will allow the keyboard user to <em>overwrite random pieces
of memory</em>.  This can lead to random crashes and security
flaws.  Approximately 50% of all computer security holes come from
this problem, which is ridiculously easy to fix.
</div>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Reading ints and floats:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%i", &a);
    printf("a = %i\n", a);

    float b;
    printf("Enter a float: ");
    scanf("%f", &b);
    printf("b = %f\n", b);

    // wait for a keypress
    getchar();
    // we need two of them because of scanf!
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<p>
Reading strings from the keyboard is more complicated.  For
reasons that we will discuss in a later lab, we <em>MUST</em>
specify a maximum size to the <code>%s</code> scanf command.  This
is done with <code>%99s</code> (if the variable's size is
<code>100</code> -- remember that the size must be <em>1 more</em>
than the number of characters we want to hold!).
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    // the sizes must match!
    char text[100];
    // no & for this variable
    scanf("%99s", text);

    printf("%s\n", text);

    // wait for a keypress
    getchar();
    // we need two of them because of scanf!
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<div class="info">
Unlike the <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>, we must
<em>not</em> use a <code>&amp;</code> in front of a
<code>char[]</code> variable in a <code>scanf</code>.
</div>

</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
<em>Mad libs</em> (similar to "ad-lib") is a popular party game in
North America.  Somebody writes a story, but removes a few nouns,
adjectives, and verbs.  Other people must supply words to replace
them (often with a clue, such as "an animal name" or "a movement
verb"), without knowing the context in which they would be used.
The result is nonsensical and sometimes funny.  For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
One day, a ________________ went to _______ and _____________ a ______.
            name of animal           place       verb (past)     noun

(other people supply: "polar bear", "Russia", "ate", and "house".)
</pre>

<p>
Write a program which implements a mad-lib game:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Unlike traditional mad-libs, your story must use numeric values
(e.g., "price in pounds, number of people") in addition to text.

</li><li>
Declare at least one int, float, and string.  The variable names
must provide clues about their function, i.e.

<pre>
char noun_animal_name[100];
int time_minutes;
</pre>

</li><li>
Ask the user to supply values for these variables.

</li><li>
Read the values from the keyboard input.

</li><li>
Convert at least one numeric variable into a different value.

</li><li>
Print out a madlib (including numeric values).

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(optional: make it funny)

<a name="functions">
<h2>Exercise 4: Functions</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
You are familiar with functions in mathematics -- you've handled
functions like g(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;x^2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2x&nbsp;-&nbsp;3.
In this case, the function <em>returns</em> a value.  The returned
value is computed based on the input.  You have also seen
functions with multiple inputs:
h(x,y)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5x&nbsp;-&nbsp;6x&nbsp;+&nbsp;x*y.
</p>

<p>
We use functions like this in programming.  In C, we need to
specify the type of variable being returned -- <code>int</code> or
<code>float</code>.  We also need to specify the type of input
variables.
</p>

<p>
We also sometimes use
functions which do not return any values -- these are useful if we
want to repeat a few commands, or simply for program organization.
These functions are called <code>void</code> functions.
</p>

<div class="info">
Functions must be declared before ("higher in the <code>.c</code>
file") they are used.
</div>

<br>

<p>
Note that each function has its own <em>scope</em> of variables.
A function cannot refer to a variable which was declared in the
<code>int main()</code> function.  In fact, you can re-use the
same variable name in different functions!
</p>

<p>
This is the time we have seen variable scope, but we can
illustrate the problem even without functions.  Consider the
following example -- it will not compile.  The
<code>int&nbsp;x</code> is defined inside an extra code block
<code>{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</code>.  The scope of variable
<code>x</code> only lasts for that code block; referring to this
variable outside of that scope will produce a compiler error.
</p>

<pre class="bad">
int main() {
    {
        int x = 0;
    }
    x = 1;
}
