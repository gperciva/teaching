<h2>Exercise 11: Timing and <code>static</code> global variables</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
To keep track of time, computers need something to measure it
against.  In C on the lab computers, we get the number of seconds
since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
</p>

<p>
As you might imagine, this produces a fairly large number -- it
exceeds the bounds of a normal <code>int</code>.  We therefore use
a <code>long&nbsp;int</code>, which has twice the number of bits
of a normal <code>int</code>.  Our <code>time.h</code> library
also defines a special data type to store the time value:
<code>time_t</code>.  On our computers, this is the same as a
<code>long&nbsp;int</code>.
</p>

<br>

<p>
We have seen how to pass information to and from functions with
arguments and return values.  Another way to share information is
via <code>static</code> global variables.  These variables are
valid within the entire <code>.c</code> file.
</p>

<div class="info">
Using global variables is generally bad programing practice,
because it increases the complexity of programs, which in turn
make it harder to debug.  However, they are required for your
second-year computer architecture course, so we present them here.

Getting the time:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;  // extra include

int main() {
    time_t now;
    now = time(NULL);

    long int a = now;
    printf("%li\n", now);
}
</pre>

<p>
Static variable:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static int shared_x;

void f() {
    int x = 3;
    shared_x = x + 1;
}

void g() {
   shared_x++;
}

int main() {
    f();
    g();
    printf("%i\n", shared_x);
}
</pre>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Modern computers can perform an amazing number of computations in
a second.  But are all computations the same?  Let's measure the
time it takes to do: <code>+ - * /</code> for <code>int</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Get the time before and after some computations.  You'll need to
repeat the computation many times in order for it to take more
than a second.  Start with 10^8.
<br>
(hint: can an <code>int</code> store 100000000 ?  You might need
to use a different type of variable for your <code>for</code>
loop, or else use two <code>for</code> loops!)

</li><li>
Write a separate function for each arithmetic operator (4
functions in total).

</li><li>
Use <code>static</code> variables to store the highest and lowest
times.

</li><li>
Print the highest and lowest times.  Do all arithmetic operations
take the same amount of time?
<br><br>
Note: you don't need to print out <em>which</em> arithmetic
operation was the fastest or slowest; you only need to print the
overall highest and lowest times.

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
(optional: repeat this experiment with <code>float</code> instead
of <code>int</code>.)

<h2>Exercise 14: <code>ncurses.h</code></h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
So far we have seen the boring <code>printf</code>, which does not
allow us to move the cursor around.  Using the additional ncurses
<em>library</em>, we can print to arbitrary places on the screen.
</p>

<p>
Since this is an additional library, not part of the standard C
libraries, we must tell the computer to include the library.  The
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;ncurses.h&gt;</code> tells the computer to
add the <code>.h</code> header file, but this unfortunately does
not tell the computer to add the <em>compiled</em> library to the
<em>linking</em> process.  To do the latter, we must add
<code>-lncurses</code> to our <code>gcc</code> command.
</p>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Here is a minimal program with <code>ncurses.h</code> which does
not print anything.
</p>

<div class="warning">
To compile it, you <em>must</em> add a <code>-lncurses</code> to
your command-line:

<pre>
gcc -o drawing.exe drawing.c -lncurses
</pre>
</div>

<pre>
#include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;

// you don't need to understand this function
void initscreen(void)
{
    initscr();
    raw();
    noecho();
    keypad(stdscr, TRUE);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    initscreen();

    // insert stuff here



    // ensure the screen is drawn
    refresh();

    // wait for a keypress
    int key = getch();
    endwin();
}
</pre>

<p>
The previous example only waited for a keypress.  Try adding the
below code fragment to print out a few characters.  What do the
numbers do?  Which is horizontal, and which is vertical?
</p>

<pre>
// print characters.  Note the single quotes!
mvaddch(5, 1, 'a');
mvaddch(1, 5, 'b');
mvaddch(9, 20, '*');
mvaddch(0, 0, '_');
</pre>

<p>
We can also print out strings:
</p>

<pre>
// print a string: note the double quotes!
mvprintw(5, 5, "kittenz rock!");
</pre>

<p>
To move the curor independently of printing something, or to print
a character or string without moving the cursor, do:
</p>

<pre>
move(10, 3);
addch('G');
printw("Bad dogs are bad.");
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Scotland">Flag
of Scotland</a> (also known as "Saint Andrew's Cross" and "the
Saltire") has a blue background with a white diagonal cross.
</p>

<div class="centeredImage">
<img src="saltire.png">
</div>

<p>
Write a program which draws this in ncurses.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Colours would be nice, but are not required.  Use stars
<code>*</code> for the background, and spaces for the cross.

</li><li>
(hint: begin by filling the background, then draw the cross on top
of it)

</li>
</ul>


<br>

<p>
(optional: the background should be blue ("Pantone 300", or
#0065bd in RGB), and the cross should be white.  Look up how to
use colours in ncurses online)

<h2>Exercise 15: Recursion</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
</p>

<p>
I therefore won't explain anything here.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Here's a popular children's song in North America (no, I don't
know why this gets taught to 6-year olds).  Note that recursion is
fairly pointless in this example (just use a <code>for</code>
loop!), but it serves as a simple example of a function calling
itself.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void bottles(int x) {
    printf("%i bottles of beer on the", x);
    printf(" wall, %i bottles of beer", x);
    printf("!\nTake one down, ");
    x--;
    printf("pass it around,\n");

    // stopping condition
    if (x == 0) {
        printf("no more bottles of ");
        printf("beer on the wall.\n");
        return;  // quit
    }
    printf("%i bottles of ", x); 
    printf("beer on the wall.\n\n");
    bottles(x);  // recursion
}

int main() {
    bottles(9);
}
</pre>

<p>
Euclid's algorithm for calcuating the greatest common divisor.
Try following the program on paper (i.e. figure out exactly what
each variable is, keep track of all the function calls, etc).  You
may find it helpful to uncomment the DEBUG printf.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// Euclid's algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    //printf("DEBUG: gcd(%i, %i)\n", a, b);

    // stopping condition
    if (b==0) {
        return a;  // quit
    } else {
        return gcd(b, a % b);  // recursion
    }
}

int main() {
    int x = 57;
    int y = 76;
    int g = gcd(x,y);
    printf("Great Common Divisor of ");
    printf("%i and %i is: %i\n", x, y, g);
}
</pre>

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<h5>Option 1: boring</h5>

<p>
Recall the Fibonacci sequence from Exercise 9 <a
href="lab3.html#arrays">Arrays</a>.  Write a function which takes
one input (<code>n</code>) and returns the <code>n</code>th
numbers in the Fibonaci sequence -- <em>without</em> using an
array to store all the intermediate values.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Remember that <code>fib(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</code> and
<code>fib(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code>.

</li><li>
All numbers&gt;1 are defined as the sum of the previous two
numbers.

</li>
</ul>


<h5>Option 2: fun, but hard</h5>

<p>
The <em>Cantor ternary set</em> is a mathematical construct which
helped lay the foundations of topology.  It is constructed by
taking a line segment and removing the middle third:
</p>

<div class="centeredImage">
<img src="cantor.png">
</div>

<p>
In beautiful text rendering, it looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
*********************************************************************************
***************************                           ***************************
*********         *********                           *********         *********
***   ***         ***   ***                           ***   ***         ***   ***
* *   * *         * *   * *                           * *   * *         * *   * *
</pre>

<p>
Write a program which draws the first 5 iterations of the Cantor ternary
set (as shown above).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Your recursive function must return a string.  You can either create a
<code>struct</code> to hold this (as we did in <a
href="lab5.html#struct">Combining variables with
<code>struct</code></a>), or return the strings directly not covered in
labs yet).

</li><li>
You will need to copy text from one array into another (not covered in
labs yet).

</li><li>
It might be useful to keep track of the width of each line section as a
global variable (not passed during the recursion).

</li><li>
Despite all these warnings, it's a really fun exercise, so don't be
discouraged!  You'll learn a lot if you try it.  :)

</li>
</ul>
