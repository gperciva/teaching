<h2>Exercise 13: Combining variables with <code>struct</code></h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
You may have noticed that functions can only return one variable.
But what if want to return more information than we can hold in
one variable?  The answer is to pack multiple variables together
into a single <em>structure</em>.
</p>

<p>
This creates a <em>new type of variable</em> which contains a
number of <em>fields</em>.  In this section's example, we create a
new type of variable called <code>struct&nbsp;SquareData</code>.
We can declare this just like other variables -- instead of
writing <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, we write
<code>struct&nbsp;SquareData</code>.
</p>

<p>
After we have declared a variable of this type with:
</p>

<pre>
struct SquareData mySquare;
</pre>

<p>
we can access its fields with <code>mySquare.side</code>,
<code>mySquare.area</code> or any other field name after the
period.
</p>


<br>

<p>
Returning a <code>struct</code> is a modern addition to the
language.  It was not supported in the original C standard in
1972, but was added in the ANSI C standard (also sometimes known
as "C89" or "C90").  Some very old compilers might not support
ANSI C.  We will see another way to return multiple values in a
few weeks.
</p>


</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Structure:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct SquareData {
  float area;
  float perimeter;
  int side;
};

struct SquareData calcSquare(int x) {
    struct SquareData mySquare;

    mySquare.side = x;
    mySquare.perimeter = 4*x;
    mySquare.area = x*x;

    // we need to return this to main()
    return mySquare;
}

void printStuff(struct SquareData mySquare) {
    // this is not useful here, but it works
    float areaBAD = mySquare.area;

    printf("The square's sides are ");
    printf("%i units long, ", mySquare.side);
    printf("and thus has \nan area of ");
    printf("%f units, and ", areaBAD);
    printf("a perimeter of ");
    printf("%f units.\n", mySquare.perimeter);
}

int main() {
    struct SquareData square;
    square = calcSquare(2);
    printStuff(square);
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<div class="warning">
The syntax of a <code>struct</code> is a bit confusing.  Make sure
that you follow the example carefully when you use them.  Be
particularly careful about the final semicolon <code>;</code>
after the <code>struct</code> definition's final <code>}</code>,
and about adding <code>struct</code> in front of the structure's
name.
</div>

<p>
Here's another example of <code>struct</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

struct TimeData {
  int total_minutes;
  int hours;
  int minutes;
};

struct TimeData calcTime(int day_minutes) {
    struct TimeData time;

    time.total_minutes = day_minutes;
    time.hours = day_minutes / 60;
    time.minutes = day_minutes % 60;

    return time;
}

void printTime(struct TimeData myTime) {
    printf("It has been ");
    printf("%i", myTime.total_minutes);
    printf(" minutes since midnight.\n");

    printf("The time is therefore ");
    printf("%02i:", myTime.hours);
    printf("%02i ", myTime.minutes);
    printf("o'clock.\n");
}

int main() {
    struct TimeData time;
    time = calcTime(123);
    printTime(time);
    time = calcTime(1234);
    printTime(time);
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Vending machines use simple programs to calculate the amount of change
to return.  For a machine, the coins are dispensed mechanically.  In our
program, we will output the numbers to the screen, looking something
like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Customer gave 10 pence, item(s) cost 7 pence.
Give customer:
&pound;2      &pound;1      50      20      10      5       2        1
0       0       0       0       0       0       1        1

Customer gave 70 pence, item(s) cost 56 pence.
Give customer:
&pound;2      &pound;1      50      20      10      5       2        1
0       0       0       0       1       0       2        0

Customer gave 200 pence, item(s) cost 124 pence.
Give customer:
&pound;2      &pound;1      50      20      10      5       2        1
0       0       1       1       0       1       0        1

Customer gave 2000 pence, item(s) cost 1232 pence.
Give customer:
&pound;2      &pound;1      50      20      10      5       2        1
3       1       1       0       1       1       1        1
</pre>

<p>
Write a program that calculates the amount of coins to return.
</p>

<div class="info">
Before you begin, figure out the math <em>on paper</em>.  Show
your formula(s) to a lab demonstrator before you start
programming.
</div>

<ul>
<li>
Your <code>int main()</code> loop must be this:

<pre>
int main() {
    struct Change coins;
    coins = getChange(7, 10);
    printChange(coins);
    coins = getChange(56, 70);
    printChange(coins);
    coins = getChange(124, 200);
    printChange(coins);
    coins = getChange(1232, 2000);
    printChange(coins);
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<div class="info">
Remember that C is case-sensitive.  As far as the computer is
concerned, UPPER-CASE letters are <em>completely</em> different
from lower-case letters!
</div>

</li><li>
You must write the <code>getChange(...)</code> and
<code>printChange(...)</code> functions, and the definition of
<code>struct&nbsp;Change</code>.  The first function must do all
the math; the second function must do all the
<code>printf(...)</code>.  Use the <code>struct&nbsp;Change</code>
to pass information between these functions.

</li><li>
Britain has the following coins: 1 pence, 2 pence, 5 pence, 10
pence, 20 pence, 50 pence, 1 pound (100 pence), and 2 pounds (200
pence).  Your machine should not dispense any bills.

</li><li>
You may assume that your vending machine has an infinite amount
of coins, but you should always dispense the largest coins first.

</li><li>
You do not need to print the pound &pound; symbol.  You may output
<code>200</code> instead of <code>&pound;2</code>.

</li><li>
Your program should use <code>int</code> for all variables, and
keep track of the number of pence instead of pounds.

<div class="warning">
You should never keep track of money with <code>float</code>.
</div>

Can you guess why?

</li>
</ul>

</p>

<br>

<p>
(optional: try using <code>float</code> (storing pounds, not pence) to
program your vending machine.  Can you make it give accurate results?)

<h2>Exercise 14: Bit manipulation</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
As engineers, you will (or <em>should</em> at least!) have more
interest in bitwise manipulation than most other programmers.
Writing software that controls lights, reacts to flipped switches,
and generally anything that interacts closely with hardware will
require bitwise operations.  The main concepts here are
<em>flags</em> and <em>bitmasks</em> (commonly known as "masks).  
</p>

<br>

<p>
A <em>flag</em> is a particular bit with a special meaning.  For
example, when representing negative numbers, the 8th bit could be
thought of a flag which indicated whether the remainder of the
bits should be interpreted as a positive or negative number.
</p>

<br>

<p>
A <em>bitmask</em> is a way of accessing a particular bit
(generally, but not always, a flag).  The bitmask is a number
which has <code>0</code> in all bits we don't care about, and a
<code>1</code> for the bit(s) that we want to examine.  By
<em>and</em>ing the bitmask with the original number, we can
"extract" the bit(s) -- if that bit was <code>0</code>, then the
new number will be completely zero; if the bit was <code>1</code>,
then the new number will be non-zero.
</p>

<p>
The same operation is done in reverse to set a flag -- by
<em>or</em>ing a bitmask and the data variable, we can set a flag
to be true.  Setting a flag can be done by <em>and</em>ing the
variable with the <em>not</em>ed bitmask.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Various bitwise operations:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char x = 0x10; // number in hex
    char y = 63;

    printf("char is a one-byte number.  ");
    printf("Printing it with %%c will treat ");
    printf("it as\nan ASCII value, but we ");
    printf("can also print it as a number: ");
    printf("x=%i y=%i.\n", x, y);

    printf("Some operations: ");
    printf("%i\t%i\n", ~x, ~y);
    printf("%i\t%i\t%i\n", x&amp;y, x|y, x^y);
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<p>
Toggling individual bits:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  // extra includes!
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

float getRand() {
    return rand() / (RAND_MAX+1.0);
}

int main() {
    srand( time(NULL) ); // init random
    char x = 0;
    char bit, bitmask;
    int i;

    // Building a bitwise random number
    for (i=0; i&lt;8; i++) {
        // set bit as 1 or 0?
        if (getRand() &gt; 0.5) {
            bit = 1;
        } else {
            bit = 0;
        }
        // get bit ready
        bitmask = bit &lt;&lt; i;
        // or them together
        x = x | bitmask;
        printf("After round %i, ",i);
        printf("bit is %i, and ", bit);
        printf("x is %i.\n", x);
    }
    getchar();
}
</pre>

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Dougie Dog has invented an "encryption" technique to keep secrets
from the Ferocious Kittens.  Fortunately, cats are extremely
intelligent, and have cracked the simple code:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Letters are grouped into pairs.  Add a space to the end of the
string if necessary to give it an even number of characters (here
"character" means <code>char</code>.

</li><li>
Make an <code>int</code> from each pair by sticking the bits from
the first letter in front of the bits from the second letter.  You
may assume that we are using 8-bit ASCII.

</li><li>
XOR the result with 31337.

</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here's two examples of encryption: "cats" and "kittens".
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Pairs: "ca ts"
<br>
"ki tt en s_" (_ represents a space)

</li><li>
into ints: 25441 29811
<br>
27497 29812 25966 29472

</li><li>
XOR with 31337: 6408 3610
<br>
4352 3613 7943 2377

</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
Decryption is performed with the same steps, but in reverse order.
</p>


<ul>
<li>
The Ferocious Kittens have intercepted two secret messages from
Dougie Dog:

<pre>
15643 6913 6916 23040 2377 6985 6408 3657 5638 3084 2119
15910 23079 13629 23101 10300 10557 23073 13092 23369
</pre>

</li><li>
Write a program that decrypts them.
<br>
(hint: this will be a lot easier if you begin by writing a program
to <em>encrypt</em> values -- you can check each step with "cats"
and "kittens" to make sure you understand the process!)

</li><li>
You <em>must</em> use a function to split a large integer into two
separate letters.  This function <em>may not</em> print anything
to the screen.
<br>
(hint: how can a function return two values?)

</li>
</ul>
