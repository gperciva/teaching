<h1>How to Think about Programming</h1>

<div class="task">
<h3>Three simple steps</h3>

<p>
If you ever ask "what do I do now?" while programming, then you
need to follow these steps.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Decide what you want the program to do</strong>.

<p>
This is simultaneously the <em>most important</em> and
<em>easiest</em> step, yet it's also the one that most people try
to skip over.
</p>

<p>
There's no "programming" involved in this step.  Just describe
what you want the program to do.  Use any natural language --
English, Chinese, Gaelic, etc.  If it helps, draw a few pictures.
Use mathematical forumlas if you want.  Do whatever you have to do
so that you have a clear idea about the program's behavior.
</p>

<p>
After all, if <em>you</em> don't know what you want the computer
to do, how on earth do you expect a <em>stupid computer</em> to
figure it out?!
</p>

</li><li>
<strong>Write a series of steps that accomplishes the
goal</strong>.

<p>
These are still aimed at <em>humans</em>, not
computers.  Write in English and mathematics, but you cannot use
any pictures at this stage.  You must describe any diagrams in
words or mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Pretend that you're going to give these instructions to another
human.  Actually, in the labs, you don't need to pretend -- ask a
lab instructor to "run" your instructions.  They will follow the
instructions as literally as possible, which may allow you to
discover problems in these instructions before you try to program
the computer.
</p>

</li><li>
<strong>Translate the steps into a programming language</strong>.

<p>
Only now do we actually start writing in C.  If you did steps 1
and 2 correctly, it should be easy: just focus on translating each
small human-instruction into code.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know how to translate a particular instruction into
code, then either look through the practice labs to learn the
syntax, or go back to step 2 and add more detail to your
human-instructions.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Don't skip to this step.  Seriously.  You'll just waste time.
Until you know what you want to do, and how to do it, don't mess
around with C.
</p>

</li>
</ol>
