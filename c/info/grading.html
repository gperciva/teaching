<h1>Lab assessment</h1>

<div class="left">
<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>
Lab material will be graded by a lab demonstrator in class.  There
are 5 marks for each exercise, with a total of 8 graded exercises.
Since labs are worth 40% of your final grade, this means that
every point in an exercise is worth 1% of your final grade.
</p>

<p>
The criteria is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>2 marks</strong>: code meets specifications.
<p>
(the bullet points under "your tasks")
</p>

</li><li>
<strong>1 mark</strong>: good code style.
<p>
(the style for this class is specified in <a href="style.html">good style</a>)
</p>

</li><li>
<strong>2 marks</strong>: two questions about your code.
<p>
(we will change your code, then ask how your program would behave
differently -- will the printed output change?  will it still
compile?  will the program produce unpredictable output?)
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
More than 50% (some people estimate 80-90%!) of a programmer's job
is <em>reading</em> code, not <em>writing</em> it.  Maintaining a
large code base is a difficult task even if the code was written
well; if it was written poorly, it becomes almost impossible.  In
addition, the easier your code is to read, the fewer mistakes you
will make in the first place!
