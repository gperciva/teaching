<h1>Using the lab software</h1>

<p>
In these labs, we use <code>gcc</code> (the GNU Compiler
Collection) on <code>cygwin</code> (a unix-like environment for
windows).  This term (spring 2010), you can find
<code>cygwin</code> under:

<blockquote>
Start menu &rarr; Electrical Engineering &rarr; Introductory
Programming &rarr; cygwin
</blockquote>

<h3>First time</h3>

<h4>Listing contents of a directory</h4>

<p>
To see a list of files in a directory (or folder), type:
</p>

<pre>
ls
</pre>

<p>
followed by <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>.  (all these commands must
be followed by an <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>)
</p>


<h4>New directory</h4>

<p>
To make a new directory (here called "<code>cpractice</code>", use:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir cpractice
</pre>


<h4>Change directory</h4>

<p>
To change (move) into a directory, use:
</p>

<pre>
cd cpractice
</pre>

To change to the directory one level up (i.e. the opposite of
<code>cd&nbsp;cpractice</code>, use:

<pre>
cd ..
</pre>


<h4>Compile a source file</h4>

<p>
When we program, we write <em>source files</em>.  A computer
cannot run these directly; it must first <em>compiler</em> it into
an <em>executable</em> file (sometimes called an <em>executable
binary</em>.
</p>

<p>
This example assumes that we have created a file called
"<code>p1.c</code>" (short for "practice 1 as a C file").
</p>

<pre>
gcc -o p1.exe p1.c
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Don't confuse <code>pl</code> (lower-case PL) with <code>p1</code>
(lower-case P one)!
</div>


<h4>Running an executable binary</h4>

<p>
After the executable has been created, we can run it with:
</p>

<pre>
./p1.exe
</pre>

<p>
Some lab computers will be able to run <code>p1.exe</code>
directly, but if that doesn't work, use <code>./p1.exe</code>
</p>

<div class="warning">
Don't confuse <code>pl</code> (lower-case PL) with <code>p1</code>
(lower-case P one)!
</div>

<h4>Running previous commands</h4>

<p>
You'll probably want to re-run a lot of commands you've already
typed in.  The shortcut is to press the UP arrow; this goes
through your command history.
</p>


<h4>Copying files</h4>

<p>
To copy a file, use:
</p>

<pre>
cp NAME.OLD NAME.NEW
</pre>

<p>
(replace UPPER-CASE as appropriate)
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Summary of commands</h3>

<p>
Replace the UPPER_CASE text with whatever is relevant.
</p>

<pre>
ls
mkdir DIR
cd DIR
cd ..
gcc -o OUTPUT.exe INPUT.c
./OUTPUT.exe
cp NAME.OLD NAME.NEW
</pre>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>File names</h3>

<p>
You can name files whatever you want, but keep the <code>.c</code>
extension for C source files and <code>.exe</code> for
executables.
</p>

<p>
I recommend that you avoid having spaces in filenames, but if you
really want to use them, you can still use that file by typing an
escape character of <code>\</code> in front of any spaces.
</p>

</div>


<div class="right">
<h3>Text editors</h3>

<p>
You may use any text editor you want.  The old labs suggested
<code>emacs</code>, but this is a very difficult editor to learn.
For the first week or two, you might prefer to use the standard
Notepad text editor that comes with Windows.
</p>

<p>
I've heard good things about <a
href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a>
and <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jedit</a> (both open-source
and free to download+share), but I haven't used them myself so I
can't fully endorse them.  You should be able to install these
programs to your H: drive.
</p>

<div class="warning">
It's worth spending a few minutes to set up your editor -- you
will spend a lot of time in it, so make sure you're comfortable!
