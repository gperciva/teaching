<h1>Why use C?</h1>

<div class="left">
<h3>Why not: C sucks</h3>

<p>
The C language is the oldest widely-used programming language; it
was developed in 1972.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It was not designed for ease-of-use or suitability for teaching.
</li><li>
It was not designed for modern computers -- C gives (and forces)
the programmer to control low-level features of the computer.
</li><li>
The language follows the philosophy of the Unix operating system:
stdin/stdout, everything is a file, etc.
</li><li>
C makes it very easy to write unsecure code
(<code>scanf("%s",&nbsp;name);</code> I'm looking at you!).
</li><li>
Almost all universities and colleges have switched to java,
python, or scheme for their introductory programming courses.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>So why use it?</h3>

<p>
Given the disadvantages of C, why are we learning it?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Because C is so old, there are many, many software libraries which
use it -- particularly libraries for scientific and engineering
processes.  Learning C will enable you to use and understand this
vast resource.

</li><li>
Due to its minimalist roots, C produces very small executables.
This doesn't matter for desktop applications, but it is absolutely
vital for writing software for "embedded systems" such as remote
control devices and fuel injection systems.

</li><li>
C forces the programmer to think about what's happening on the
hardware level.  For most programmers, this is a disadvantage, but
as electrical engineers, this turns into a pedagogical advantage.

</li>
</ul>
