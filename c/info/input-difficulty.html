<h1>Why is input so difficult in C?</h1>

<div class="left">
<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>
As we mentioned in <a href="../info/why-c.html">Why are we
learning C</a>, the C language is fairly low-level: it
deliberately mimics the way that computer architectures work.
This is a good idea when the programmer must optimize every aspect
of the program (15-30 years ago), or in understanding how the
hardware works (your 2nd year "system architecture" course).  But
this causes problems when non-experts try to build useful or
interesting programs.
</p>

<p>
In order to simplify input and output, the C language treats
everything as a file.  This produces smaller executables and
requires less work to port the language to a new computer
architecture, but it means that the computer does not do certain
automatic checks.
</p>

<br>

<p>
For example, when the computer executes
<code>scanf("%i",&nbsp;&amp;x);</code> it will look for an
<code>int</code> in the <code>stdin</code> (standard input)
"file".  If it does not find an <code>int</code>, the function
will return a <code>0</code>.  The function will not advance
beyond the point of incorrect input -- C does not make assumptions
about what you, the programmer, wants to do.  If the programmer
wants to skip over the non-<code>int</code> data, then the
programmer is expected to know how to do this.
</p>

<br>

<p>
A famous problem in C is memory management.  C does not try to
take care of memory for you; it does exactly what the programmer
tells it to do.  This is unfortunate when reading text from the
keyboard -- as we see in <a href="../labs/lab5.html">Lab 5</a>,
text is an array of characters.  If nothing tells the computer to
<em>stop</em> reading text from the keyboard, it will continue to
read text from the keyboard, merrily replacing vital system
information with the text it reads from the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
However, this is not the only problem.  We can limit the number of
characters with <code>scanf("%4s",&nbsp;text);</code>.  However,
this means that anything over 4 characters will still be in the
keyboard buffer -- <code>scanf</code> will not remove any extra
characters from the buffer.  We must do that manually.
</p>

<div class="info">
Some websites recommend using one of these:
<pre>
fflush(NULL)
fflush(stdin)
</pre>

However, <code>fflush</code> is intended for <em>output</em>
streams.  It is not guaranteed to clear an <em>input</em> stream
like <code>stdin</code>.
</div>

<h3>Reading text safely</h3>

<p>
Limit the number of characters, and clear the keyboard buffer
after reading a string:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// you're not expected to understand this.
void clearKeyboardBuffer() {
    char ch;
    while ((ch = getchar() != '\n') &amp;&amp; (ch != EOF));
}

int main() {
    char text[5];
    printf("Enter some text (4 chars max):\n");
    scanf("%4s", text);
    printf("You typed: %s\n", text);

    clearKeyboardBuffer();

    printf("Again:\n");
    scanf("%4s", text);
    printf("You typed: %s\n", text);
}
</pre>

<div class="info">
Note that this is one of the few times that you will see a
<code>while&nbsp;(...);</code> loop (with a semicolon
<code>;</code> at the end, instead of a code block
<code>{&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</code>.
</div>

<br>

<p>
Check if the input was an integer:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// you're not expected to understand this.
void clearKeyboardBuffer() {
    char ch;
    while ((ch = getchar() != '\n') &amp;&amp; (ch != EOF));
}

int main() {
    int x;
    int was_int;

    printf("Please enter an integer: \n");
    was_int = scanf("%i", &amp;x);
    while (!was_int) {
        printf("That wasn't an integer!");
        printf("  Try again: \n");
        clearKeyboardBuffer();
        was_int = scanf("%i", &amp;x);
    }
    printf("Thanks, your int was %i.\n", x);
}
</pre>

</div>
