<h1>Programming at Home</h1>

<div class="info">
If you work seriously for the scheduled lab times and ask
questions when appropriate, you should have no difficulty
finishing the labs.  However, if you fall behind due to browsing
facebook, leaving early, and not asking questions when you feel
lost, then you might want to do additional work at home to catch
up.

<br><br>

If you have problems with the instructions below, then we'll try
to help as best we can, but it's difficult to help with computer
problems without the computer.  If you have a laptop and bring it
in, then we can probably help, but if you have a desktop and run
into problems, we might not be able to do much.

<h3>Setting up the compiler</h3>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>
Most Linux distributions will come with a typical development
environment (including <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>).
If yours doesn't, install those packages.  Note that some
distributions have a <code>gcc-base</code> package which does
<em>not</em> include the full <code>gcc</code>.
</p>

<h4>MacOS X</h4>

<p>
MacOS X comes with "Xcode" or "Developer tools", either as an
extra CD, or as an optional install on the DVD.  Once you install
that, you will have a full developer environment.
</p>

<p>
You can either write text files and run <code>gcc</code> on the
command-line, or run Xcode and compile from within that
environment.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>
To get an experience similar to the lab setup, install cygwin.
This is a free, open-source collection of programs.
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the basic cygwin install does not include gcc.  To
install it, you must select <code>gcc4</code> and
<code>libncurses-devel</code> during the "package selection"
phase.
</p>

<p>
The package <code>gcc4-core</code> does <em>not</em> set it up
correctly.  For more information, see the cygwin documentation.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Another option is to install a different C compiler, such as the
one in Microsoft Visual C++.  For most of the material in this
course, there is no problem with this software.  However, see the
warnings to the right.
</p>

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>
In general, any C compiler will be able to handle the material we
cover in this 1st-year course.  However, there are a few
exceptions.
</p>

<!--
<h4>Minefield exercises</h4>

<p>
The minefield labs require you to replace compiled <code>.o</code>
object files.  Unfortunately, object files are <em>not</em>
portable between different operating systems.  In fact, they are
not even guaranteed to work on different versions of cygwin.
</p>

<p>
The supplied object files for minefield were compiled on an Ubuntu
9.04 on x86 (<em>not</em> 64-bit), and on the lab computers for
Windows/cygwin.  If you have a different developer environment
(including a more recent version of cygwin), then there's no way
that you can compile minefield at home.
</p>

<p>
However, you can still work on the "prep" labs.  Since the
minefield labs do not introduce any material that is not covered
by the prep labs, this option covers the bulk of work in the
course.
</p>
-->

<h4><code>ncurses</code></h4>

<p>
Some of the labs use a library called <code>ncurses</code>.  This
is available on linux, MacOS X, and cygwin, but is probably not
available for non-cygwin windows.  If you are using Microsoft
Visual C++, Borland Turbo C, Watcom C, or another windows-specific
C compiler, then you cannot work on those exercises at home.
</p>


<h4>ANSI C</h4>

<p>
The labs use C that conforms to the ANSI C standard (sometimes
called C89 or C90).  Certain very old C compilers (i.e.
pre-1990) might not accept these additions to the C language.
</p>

<p>
I really doubt that this will be a problem, though.
