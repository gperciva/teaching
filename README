These are labs I've used in teaching programming to electrical
engineering students at Glasgow university.

Disclaimers:
- All of these labs are the product of unpaid extra work that I
  did voluntarily because the alternative was too horrible to
  bear.  As such, the work is considerably below what I would
  normally consider "acceptable quality" -- once the lab was good
  enough to get students started in the right direction, I stopped
  working on it.  I accept no blame for any faults in the labs.

- I provided some input to the syllabus, but the final call was
  always the lecturer, not me.  These labs include some stuff
  that I don't think is useful; they even include some stuff that
  I think is actively harmful to students learning to program.
  (e.g. pointers, excessive amounts of sine waves)
  Again, I accept no fault for these.
