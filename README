These are labs I've used in teaching programming to electrical
engineering students at Glasgow university.

Disclaimers:
- All of these labs are the product of unpaid extra work that I
  did voluntarily because the alternative was too horrible to
  bear.  As such, the work is considerably below what I would
  normally consider "acceptable quality" -- once the lab was good
  enough to get students started in the right direction, I stopped
  working on it.  I accept no blame for any faults in the labs.

"The Lecturer" has now rewritten a lot of the course with
Python and PyQt, although it's now been replaced by
a completely new course and back to C++ again, as it's for
electronics engineers who will be doing embedded stuff.
This can stay here in case it's of any use to anyone.
