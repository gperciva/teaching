<h1>Lab assessment</h1>

<div class="left">
<h3>Grades</h3>

<p>
Lab material will be graded by the main lab demonstrator.  There
are 5 marks for each graded lab.  The criteria is split into three
categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>2 marks</em>: code meets specifications.
<p>(0 = none, 1 = partial, 2 = all)</p>

</li><li>

<em>2 marks</em>: student understands and can explain the code.
<p>(0 = cannot explain, 1 = can answer simple questions, 2 = good
understanding)</p>

</li><li>
<em>1 mark</em>: good code style.
<p>(0 = poor style, 1 = good style)</p>

</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class="right">
<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>
More than 50% (some people estimate 80-90%!) of a programmer's job
is <em>reading</em> code, not <em>writing</em> it.  Maintaining a
large code base is a difficult task even if the code was written
well; if it was written poorly, it becomes almost impossible.  In
addition, the easier your code is to read, the fewer mistakes you
will make in the first place!
