<h1>Programming at Home</h1>

<div class="info">
If you work seriously for the scheduled lab times and ask
questions when appropriate, you should have no difficulty
finishing the labs.  However, if you fall behind due to browsing
facebook, leaving early, and not asking questions when you feel
lost, then you might want to do additional work at home to catch
up.

<br><br>

If you have problems with the instructions below, then we'll try
to help as best we can, but it's difficult to help with computer
problems without the computer.  If you have a laptop and bring it
in, then we can probably help, but if you have a desktop and run
into problems, we might not be able to do much.

<h3>Python 3.x</h3>

<div class="warning">
Use python 3.5 or newer; do not use python 2.x.
</div>

<p>
The language syntax and semantics changed significantly
between versions 2 and 3 of python. As of 2016, we have
switched to python&nbsp;3 for Audio Programming.
There is still a lot of python&nbsp;2 in the world,
but its use is discouraged for new projects.
