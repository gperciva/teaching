<h2>Exercise 11: look-up table (full)</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Calling <em>sin(x)</em> requires a lot of CPU power (relatively
speaking).  Implementing trig functions in hardware takes a lot of
silicon.  Can we reduce this burden?
</p>

<p>
Yes, and the answer is a look-up table.  Before starting our
program, we pre-calculate one full cycle of a sine wave.  We store
that in memory, and then when we want to calculate <em>sin(x)</em>
during our program, we look at the table in memory instead of
calculating it fresh each time.  When dealing with silicon, the
look-up table can be written in ROM (read-only memory) instead of
calculated.

There are some notes here: <a

Skip over chapter 1, and read chapter 2 up to and including
<em>section 2.3 Determining the Table Length</em>.  A print-out of
this material will be handed out in class.

<h3>Maths homework</h3>

<div class="info">
Do this homework on paper.  I know that writing stuff on paper by
hand is a drag, but it will save you a lot of time and effort in
the long run.
</div>

<p>
Answer these questions, assuming you are creating CD-quality audio
(44100 Hz, 16-bit samples, stereo channels).
</p>

<ul>
<li>
How large should your look-up table (a numpy array) be for a sine
wave?
</li><li>
What should the phase increment be to play a sine wave at 1 Hz?
</li><li>
What should the phase increment be to play a sine wave at 100 Hz?

</li><li>

Make a rough plot of these two functions:
<pre>
f(x) = sin(x)
g(x) = sin(2*x)
</pre>

Suppose you wanted to create a look-up table for g(x).  How large
should that table be?

</li><li>

Write a look-up table for a sine wave with 10 samples, i.e.

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr><td>Index</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Value</td><td>0</td><td>0.588</td><td>0.951</td><td>...</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Assume that you are producing audio at 10 hz (yes, ridiculously
low!).

<ul>
<li>
Using your table, write the first 10 values you will use for the
audio to produce a sine wave at 2 hz.  Make a rough plot of those
values; does the result look like a sine wave?

</li><li>
Using your table as much as possible, write the first 5 values you
will use for the audio to produce a sine wave at 0.5 hz.  Use any
reasonable approximation to generate the values you have not
pre-calculated.

</li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<div class="warning">
Stop!  Before you try to write a program, you must finish the
maths homework.
</div>

<p>
Let the user specify a frequency, then generate a sine wave at
that frequency
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You must calculate your look-up table before asking the user for
their desired frequency.  (this imitates the table being
implemented in ROM with silicon)

</li><li>
You must use a class for your SineOscillator.  All data (look-up
table, internal state, etc) must be part of that class.

</li><li>
Given the previous point, you should not need to change anything
from your program in exercise 10 other than your SineOscillator
class.

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise 12: look-up table (quarter)</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Storing a full sine wave in ROM requires a bunch of silicon.  Can
we reduce this burden?
</p>

<p>
Yes, and the answer is a partial look-up table.  In particular, a
sine wave can be re-created using only one quarter of a cycle; the
other three quarters are simple the original quarter flipped
across the y axis and/or mirrored around the x axis.
</p>

<p>
There are some notes here: <a

Skip over chapter 1, and read chapter 2 up to and including
<em>section 2.4 Shortening the Lookup Table</em>.  A print-out of
this material will be handed out in class.

<ul>
<li>
Plot one full sine wave, then draw vertical lines diving it into
quarters.  For each quarter, indicate whether the quarter is
mirrored or flipped.

</li><li>
Write a <em>quarter</em> look-up table for a sine wave with 10
samples, i.e.
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
