<h2>Exercise 17: A Very Simple Example</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Python isn't the fastest language. It's certainly great
for rapid prototyping and cuts development time by a
great deal, but at run time it's slow, and can't easily make
use of multiple cores you find even in telephones, let
alone desktop workstations. C(++) on the other hand is
more difficult to develop, but offers potentially huge
speed advantages by being "close to the metal".
There will very probably come a time when at least the speed-critical
part of your Python needs to be faster, or you might just
want to call one of the function libraries developed in
C(++) over the last 4 decades.
</p>

<p>
Python is written in C, so of course it's possible to
extend it by writing new functionality in C(++).
However, calling a C(++) function from Python or using
a C++ class as a Python one requires a lot of boiler-plate
code because of the differences between the languages.
Just think about them:
<table>
	<tr><th></th><th>Python</th><th>C(++)</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Types</th><td>Dynamic</td><td>Static, Strict</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Allocation</th><td>On demand</td><td>Explict</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Memory Management</th><td>Garbage collection</td><td>RAII, explicit or end-of-scope deletion</td></tr>
</table>
Every call to a C(++) function from Python needs to take
these differences into consideration, and that makes for
a lot of tedious, error prone work to connect the two
together. Who allocates memory for the variables passed
between the Python and C(++) contexts? Who frees that memory?
How do we check that the right version of the C(++) function
is being called and that the types agree?
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Python is designed to make things as painless
as possible, to the extent that almost all of the boiler-plate
can be generated automatically by a Simple Wrapper Interface Generator
program. One of these programs is called (guess...) SWIG.
</p>

<p>
Our game plan is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Write a function in C++.</li>
	<li>Write a test harness for it in C++;
		compile and link them;
		make sure the function works.</li>
	<li>Write an interface specification file
		explaining to SWIG what the function does.</li>
	<li>Parse the i-file with SWIG to generate the wrapper code.</li>
	<li>Link the wrapper and your original C++ object files
		to produce a shared library.</li>
	<li>Start Python, import the shared library
		just line any regualar Python module, and enjoy.</li>
</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Command Reminders and References</h3>

<p>
You'll aready know that you can compile a C++ program using the 
GNU compiler with the following command
<pre class="example">
g++ -o &lt; output_file_name&gt; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input_file_names&gt; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-I&lt;include_file_path&gt; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-L&lt;library_path&gt; -l&lt;library&gt;
</pre>
and that unless you specify otherwise with the <em>-o</em> flag,
the program is written into a file called <em>a.out</em>
(assembler output). Of course, you can leave the flags you don't
need out, and the include file and library search paths will have
sensible defaults if the compiler has been properly installed.
</p>

<p>
To work with SWIG you'll need to know
about these other compiler options:
<table>
	<tr><th>&#8209;c</th><td>Compile only: don't link.
			Produces an output file with the same name
			but a <em>.o</em> extension (by default).</td></tr>
	<tr><th>&#8209;fPIC</th><td>Produce Position Independent Code,
			i.e. code which may be loaded at any memory address
			without modification, and is therefore suitable to
			be used in a shared library.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>&#8209;shared</th><td>Link the named object files
			resolving as many references as possibe producing
			a shared object library (extension <em>.so</em>).
</table>
<hr/>
<p>
The <code>python3-config</code> command is your friend.
If you want to know which include files to use compile
your SWIG wrapper, <code>python3-config &#8209;&#8209;includes</code>
will tell you.
Type it at the prompt and see what it says.
Try <code>ldflags</code> instead of <code>includes</code>.
Remember you can get output of a command
such as this included in the command you type using either
<code>` cmd `</code> or <code>$( cmd )</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="">SWIG documentation</a> is very comprehensive,
although aimed at expert users. Check out the
<a href="http://www.swig.org/exec.html">Executive Summary</a>.
SWIG works with many languages, not just Python, so you'll
find the <a href="http://www.swig.org/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> useful
as well as the more detailed information about
<a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html#Python_nn10">SWIG and Python</a>.

<h3>Your task...</h3>
<div class="info">
	In this elementary example, I'm going to give you
	all the code. You will have to understand it thoroughly.
	You won't be able to write your own unless you do.
	That means every single operator, statement and
	preprocessor directive in what follows must be absolutely
	clear to you.
</div>
<p>
Write two c++ files. In one, write a function which prints
"Hello, " followed by its argument. Then write a test file
with a main function in it to make sure your C function behaves
as you wish it to behave. For example, here's the header file:
<pre class="code">
// File: simple_hello.h
//
// Print a greeting.
//

#include &lt;string&gt;

void hw(std::string who = std::string("World"));
</pre>
here's the implementation:
<pre>
// File: simple_hello.cxx
//
// Implementation of the Hello function suite in C++

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

#include "simple_hello.h"

void hw(std::string who)
{
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; who &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
and here's the evaluation program:
<pre>
// File: simple_hello_test.cxx

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include "simple_hello.h"

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        cout &lt;&lt; "Calling hw()\n";
        hw();
        cout &lt;&lt; "Calling hw(argv[0])\n";
        hw(argv[0]);
	return 0;
}
</pre>
</p>

<div class="info">
	If you are using a machine which has its Python environment
	and numpy installations in non-standard places, you'll need
	to do a bit of extra spade work. For example, the machines
	in the lab have anaconda installed, which you'll want to use
	in preference to their standard Python environment.
	Make sure the computer looks there first for executables
	with<br/>
	<code>export PATH=/local/anaconda/32/bin/:$PATH</code><br/>
	You only have to issue this command once per session.
</div>

<p>
Compile this and test it. Maybe say <br/>
<code>g++ -o simple_hello simple_hello_test.cxx simple_hello.cxx<br/>
./simple_hello<br/></code>
</p>

<p>
Now we have to bind this to python. First write an interface file.
In very simple cases like this, you can instruct SWIG simply to
parse the C(++) header file and work out what's going on for itself.
Let's call our python module <em>simple_hello</em>. A suitable
interface file might contain:
<pre>
/* File: simple_hello.i */

/* Name our python module */
%module simple_hello

/* We'll be using C++ standard library strings */
%include &lt;std_string.i&gt;

/* Put the literal code needed at the top of the output file */
%{
#define SWIG_FILE_WITH_INIT
#include "simple_hello.h"
%}

/* Parse the c++ header file and generate the output file */
%include "simple_hello.h"
</pre>
Note that the awfully nice SWIG people have already provided
interface files for much of the C++ standard library, including
the C++ string type. We take the opportunity to put two
C preprocessor directives at the top of the wrapper file;
as we get more advanced, we can add extra python-specific
functionality to the wrapper, but for now these two lines are
all you need. They are simply copied into the output file.
We then parser our "library" header file and prodeuce the
C++ code.
</p>

<p>
To generate the wrapper code for our <em>simple_hello</em> module
you need to say<br/>
<code>swig -c++ -python simple_hello.i</code><br/>
which tells swig to enable C++ processing, use Python as the
target language, and to perform the actions required by the
interface file. This will generate a file called <em>simple_hello_wrap.cxx</em>
which you should feel free to look at. You should never have to edit
this file (which is just as well!): you can change the interface
file instead to modify it's behaviour.
</p>

<p>
We're almost there now. We have to make position independent object
files and link them into a shared library, then import that into a
Python session. Here are the appropriate incantations:
<code><br/>g++ -fPIC -c simple_hello.cxx<br/>
g++ -fPIC -c simple_hello_wrap.cxx $( python3-config &#8209;&#8209;includes )<br/>
g++ -shared simple_hello_wrap.o simple_hello.o -o _simple_hello.so<br/></code>
Note the leading underscore character on the filename of the
shared object, and that I told the C++ compiler to look in
Python's include directory for the necessary header files
to connect with the Python interpreter. The include directory
might be different on the machine you're using.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you might need extra linkage flags. For example,
MacOS requires a whole bunch of stuff to do with frameworks.
You might try appending <code> $(&nbsp;python3-config&nbsp;--ldflags&nbsp;)</code>
to the last line if you get linkage errors. On a Mac, you'd
also normally use the <code>.dylib</code> extension instead
of <code>.so</code>, and say <code>-dynamiclib</code> instead
of <code>-shared</code>.
</p>

<div class="info">
	If you have a very old C++ compiler, you might have to
	encourage it to use the modern standard by adding the
	flags <code>&#8209;&#8209;std=c++0x</code>
	or <code>&#8209;&#8209;std=c++11</code>.
	The C++ produced by SWIG relies on modern language features.
</div>

<p>
You should have covered the use of build tools in an earlier
programming class. Once you've understood what's going on,
you might save yourself some time by writing a Makefile
so that you can run all of the necessary steps by simply
typing make. There is an example of how to construct a
make file in the appendix of the
<a href="http://markov.music.gla.ac.uk/AP_Sandpit/mcm.pdf">MCM</a> document.

<h2>Exercise 18: SWIG and numpy nd-arrays</h2>
<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
The <a href="#very-simple-swig">simple</a> Hello World program
in passed a value to a C++ function. It didn't return
any value, but returning simple built-in types
(<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>
etc) is handled trivially by SWIG and you can call the function
entirely as expected, using the return value in Python as normal.
</p>

<p>
An issue arises with C(++) types which are semantically
ambiguous. In C (and C++, although it's frowned upon),
strings are represented as null-terminated character arrays,
and passed around the programmer as pointers to their
first character. Indeed, the declaration
<br/><code>char* s = "Hi";</code>
<br/>is really just a shorthand for
<br/><code>char* s = {'H', 'i', '\0'};</code>
<br/> The C "string" doesn't even have a method to determine
its length; it's just a pointer, not an object.
So what is SWIG to do with the pointer-to-char type?
There is a possibility that the C programmer really did
mean a pointer-to-character and it isn't to be regarded
as a "string".
</p>

<p>
The solution that SWIG offers to this is the application
of "Typemaps". A Typemap tells SWIG to generate some specific
code when the variable maps a type template. Most specific
templates are considered first (and they can include the
name of the variable), so it's possible to specify how
a variable is to be treated on a case-by-case basis.
Writing the Typemap requires a fairly intimate kowledge
of SWIG and the Python run-time, but the numpy authors
have provided an interface file for their package, so we
are in the happy position of only ever having to use those
which we're given.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it's worth noting that as well as functions, SWIG
will convert wrappers for C++ classes wholesale if required.
The wrapped class in the C++ appears as a regular Python
class, and all of its public methods are accessible from
Python.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
	<h3>Using Supplied numpy nd-array Typemaps</h3>
	<p>
	To make use of the Typemaps provided to support
	numpy nd-arrays through SWIG, it's necessary to
	include in your interface file the instructions
	to read numpy's interface file and initialise
	the necessary array-support code. The first two
	stanzas of the following code fragment achieve
	this.
	</p>
	<pre class="code">
%include &lt;numpy.i&gt;

%init %{
import_array();
%}

%apply (double* IN_ARRAY1, int DIM1) {
  (const double* in, std::size_t in_size)
};
%apply (double* INPLACE_ARRAY1, int DIM1) {
  (double* out, std::size_t out_size)
};
        </pre>
	<p>
	The final two stanzas apply the numpy array Typemaps to
	functions which have the named arguments and types. You
	have to understand that numpy.i is designed to pass arrays
	using the convention of supplying a pointer to the first
	element and the length of the dimension.
	The first <code>%apply</code> instructs functions with the
	formal parameter list <code>(double* in, int in_size)</code>
	to be treated as if described in the Typemaps IN_ARRAY1
	and DIM1. So supplying a <em>single nd-array argument</em>
	in the Python call invokes the C function with <em>two</em>
	arguments: a pointer to the first element and the size of
	the first (only) dimension. To know that, you have to read
	the manual.
	</p>
	<p>
	numpy.i provides a choice of signiatures for arrays of up
	to 4D. To pass a 2D array, for example, you might use the
	signiature
	<code>(DATA_TYPE* IN_ARRAY2, int DIM1, int DIM2)</code>
	where DATA_TYPE can be one of the supported types (that includes
	almost any simple type you can think of).
	</p>
	<p>
	Notice that the IN_ARRAY can't be modified: the C(++) type
	which it is applied to is represented by a const pointer.
	If you want to modify the Python array with the C function,
	you must use a INPLACE_ARRAY1, INPLACE_ARRAY2, etc.
	Python often returns more than one value with calls like
	<code>a,b=myfunction(x)</code>, but C(++) usually achieves
	this by having pointers (or references) passed to the function.
	If you code already uses numpy, and the return values are all
	of the same type, an INPLACE array might be used to return
	them. There is also the ARGOUTVIEWM_ARRAYx template to allow
	properly memory-managed views of public arrays in your C++:
	check out the documentation. However, if you want to return
	multiple values, you might ask yourself whether you shouldn't
	do the Pythonic thing and return a tuple.

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>
<p>
First of all, provide the implementation for the
class described below. Then implement the resonator
you built in python using C++ from scratch.
</p>

<div class="info">
	If you have your own local copy of numpy, tell the C++
	compiler to use its header files with (e.g.)<br/>
	<code>export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/local/anaconda/32/lib/python3.5/site&#8209;packages/numpy/core/include/</code>
	<br/>That's where anaconda's up-to-the-minute numpy resides
	on the lab machines.
</div>

<p>
To illustrate the techniques involved, I've made a couple
of functions which calculate the minimum, maximum and sum
of an 1D numpy array of doubles. The calculation is done
in C++.
</p>

<p>
The functions are gratuitously wrapped in a class, for no
other reason than to show the calling convention. They are
static functions so they belong to the class and you don't
have to instantiate an object to use them. <code>mms_t</code>
calculates the maximum, minimum and sum and returns them
as a tuple (actually a Python list). <code>mms_a</code>
returns the values in a numpy array which the caller is
responsible for creating.
</p>

<p>
Here is the header file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
// File: min_max_sum.h
//
// Given an array of double, return its minumum and
// maximum values and the sum of its contents in
// diverse and amusing ways.
//

#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

class MMS {
public:
        // return the min, max and sum of the given array.
        // SWIG will arrange for this to be returned as a tuple.
        static void mms_t(const double* in, std::size_t in_size,
                          double* min, double* max, double* sum);

        // return the min, max and sum of the given numpy array 'in'.
        // SWIG will write the values into the give numpy array, 'out'.
        static void mms_a(double* out, std::size_t out_size,
                          const double* in, std::size_t in_size);
};
</pre>
<p>
And here is the interface specification
</p>
<pre class="code">
/* File: min_max_sum.i */

/* Name our python module */
%module min_max_sum

/* Put the literal code needed at the top of the output file */
%{
#define SWIG_FILE_WITH_INIT
#include "min_max_sum.h"
%}

/* The typemaps interface file lets us use the *OUTPUT Typemap.
   This will enable us to use pointers to variables as return results.
   If more than one *OUTPUT is matched, a tuple gets constructed. */
%include &lt;typemaps.i&gt;

/* Use the numpy interface for ndarrays. See the warning below */
%include &lt;numpy.i&gt;

%init %{
import_array();
%}

/* Match the arguments of our various C++ methods */
%apply (double* IN_ARRAY1, int DIM1) { (const double* in, std::size_t in_size) };
%apply double *OUTPUT { double* min, double* max, double* sum };
%apply (double* INPLACE_ARRAY1, int DIM1) { (double* out, std::size_t out_size) };

/* Parse the c++ header file and generate the output file */
%include "min_max_sum.h"

</pre>
<p>
Just to prove it works, here's a session running on Nick's laptop:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from min_max_sum import MMS
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = np.zeros(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; MMS.mms_t(np.array([1,4,3,7]))
[1.0, 7.0, 15.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; MMS.mms_a(result,np.array([1,4,3,7]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
array([  1.,   7.,  15.])
</pre>

<div class="info">
	Some Linux distributions of python3-numpy don't
	package the <em>numpy.i</em> interface file.
	This is a bug.
	If your copy of SWIG complains about not being
	able to find numpy.i, you'll have to download one
	and put it in the same directory as your code.
