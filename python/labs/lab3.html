<h2>Exercise 8: Arrays</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
An <em>array</em> is an ordered sequence of values; you cannot
rearrange values without changing the meaning).  A two-dimensional
array is just a normal "table".
</p>

<p>
In python, we will use arrays from the <code>numpy</code>
(numerical python) module.  Note that these arrays are
<em>zero-indexed</em>.
</p>

<p>
creates an array in memory, storing each value at the appropriate
index:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr><td>Index</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Value</td><td>3</td><td>-2</td><td>987</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Initializing and displaying:
</p>

<pre>
import numpy
# initialize all positions with 0
arr = numpy.zeros(8)
print arr
</pre>

<p>
Arrays, functions, math, and graphs:
</p>

<pre>
import numpy
import pylab
import math

# this modifies arr directly.
# can be dangerous!
def modify_array(arr):
    # len(x) returns the length of x
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = math.exp(i)
    return arr

arr1 = numpy.zeros(8)
arr1 = modify_array(arr1)

arr2 = numpy.zeros(6)
# do math on entire array at once
arr2 = (arr2 + 1) * 400

pylab.plot(arr1)
pylab.plot(arr2)
pylab.show()
</pre>

<p>
Display graphs for three sine waves on the same graph.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
sine wave at 100 hz

</li><li>
sine wave at 440 hz

</li><li>
sine wave at 440, <em>pi/2</em> radians out of phase with the
previous wave

</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pick a sampling rate sufficient to demonstrate whatever you think
we're trying to demonstrate.

<h2>Exercise 9: Reading and writing wav files</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Most of the audio done in this class will be through wav files,
since these are easily created in a cross-platform manner.  (this
is so you can do homework at home instead of in the lab -- aren't
I nice?  :)
</p>

<p>
One warning is that python tries to avoid losing any precision.
If you do an operation like dividing by 2 using integer types, you
would normally lose prevision -- as a result, python automatically
switches to floats.  That's generally a good idea, but most audio
programs only support wavfiles with samples in <em>16-bit
integer</em> format, not <em>64-bit float</em>.  As a result, we
convert the samples back into <code>int16</code> before writing
the wavfile.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Reading and writing a file.  Download <a
href="a440-1second.wav">a440-1second.wav</a> and place it in the
same directory as your <code>.py</code> file.
</p>

<pre>
import numpy
import scipy.io.wavfile
# the double ** is a power operator, i.e. 2^15
convert_16_bit = float(2**15)

sample_rate, samples = scipy.io.wavfile.read(
    "a440-1second.wav")
print "Data type is:", samples.dtype

# scale to -1.0 -- 1.0
samples = samples / convert_16_bit
print "Data type is now:", samples.dtype

# change the file
samples = samples * 0.5

# scale to -32768 -- 32767
samples = numpy.int16( samples * convert_16_bit )
print "Data type is now:", samples.dtype

scipy.io.wavfile.write("quieter.wav",
    sample_rate, samples)
</pre>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Two steps to this exercise:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Write a program which asks the user for a frequency, then
generates a wavfile with a 1-second sine wave at that frequency.
</li><li>
Modify your previous program so that it asks the user for multiple
sine waves.  Keep on asking for more frequencies until the user
types a <code>0</code>.
<br>
Once you have all the frequencies, "<em>mix</em>" them together
to create a single 1-second wavfile containing sine waves of those
frequencies at once.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise 10: Classes and buffer-based audio</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
So far we have been creating the entire audio file in a single
array.  That's fine on desktop computers creating 1 second of
audio (assuming 44100 Hz with 16-bit samples, that's
44100*16/8/1024 = 86 Kb memory), but what if you wanted to create
an hour's worth of audio at once?  That would be 300 megs of
memory!  do-able on modern desktops, but kind-of a waste.
</p>

<p>
So instead, we will create audio in small bits and pieces.  A
buffer size of 2048 is fairly traditional.  How many buffers will
we need to create 1 second of audio?
</p>

<br>

<p>
In order to generate a sine wave that is "continuous" over
multiple buffers, we need store the state -- the <em>x</em> in
<em>sin(x)</em>.  (Replace <em>x</em> with <em>t</em> or
<em>i</em> or <em>n</em> depending on your background)
</p>

<p>
We do this with things called "classes and objects".  A
<em>class</em> is a combination of data and functions which act on
that data -- you can think of them like a type of variable (like
int or float).  An <em>object</em> is a specific instance of that
variable type.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Classes:
</p>

<pre>
# by convention we capitalize a class name
class CounterOne:
    x = 0
    # note the "self" in the argument list!
    def get_next(self):
        # note the self.x
        y = self.x
        self.x = self.x+1
        return y

# note the capitalization (convention)
counter = CounterOne()
for i in range(8):
    print counter.get_next()
</pre>

<p>
Silly example for using two classes:
</p>

<pre>
import random

class CounterOne:
    x = 0
    def get_next(self):
        y = self.x
        self.x = self.x+1
        return y

class CounterTwo:
    x = 0
    def get_next(self):
        y = self.x
        self.x = self.x+2
        return y

if random.random() &lt; 0.5:
    counter = CounterOne()
else:
    counter = CounterTwo()

# the code here doesn't know if it's
# using CounterOne or CounterTwo!
for i in range(8):
    print counter.get_next()
</pre>

<p>
More useful example -- read this one carefully!
</p>

<pre>
class CounterOne:
    x = 0
    increment_value = 0

    # this function *must* be called __init__()
    def __init__(self, increment_value):
        # you *must* write "self"
        self.increment_value = increment_value

    def get_next(self):
        # you *must* write "self"
        y = 0.1 * (self.x)
        self.x = self.x + self.increment_value
        return y

# pass in increment_value
counter = CounterOne(4)
for i in range(8):
    print counter.get_next()
</pre>


</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Write a program that generates waves in buffers of 2048 samples.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You may use a long array to store your final answer before
writing it to disk with <code>scipy.io.wavfile.write()</code>.
This is because we have not covered how to write a wavfile
incrementally -- you still <em>must</em> generate the waves
in small bits.
</li><li>
Give the user the option to pick from at a sine wave or at least
one other wave of your choice (sawtooth, square, triangular, etc).
</li><li>
You <em>must</em> use a class to generate each wave.
<br>
(hint: name your classes "SineOscillator" and "SquareOscillator"
instead of "Counter")
</li><li>
You do not need to support multiple waves at once (i.e. additive
synthesis).  But if you're bored, go ahead!
</li><li>
You do not need to let the user specify the amplitude and phase of
each wave, but it would be neat if you did.  :)
</li>
</ul>
