<h2>Exercise 25: Research Seminar!</h2>
<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>
<p>
Research the literature and present a short (15-minute) presentation on a
Music Technology topic of your choice, to be presented at the Science and Music
Research Group Seminar on Issues in Music Technology.
</p>
<p>
If you have agreed your on topic for Exercise&nbsp;21 already, you may present
on that. You may not present on any of the given topics for Exercise&nbsp;21.
</p>
<p>
You can use moodle, web sites, html files with links in a browser,
demonstrations etc., but the use of
Powerpoint or any similar software product designed to make vacuous
executives look important or knowledgeable will result in <em>instant failure</em>
and possible disciplinary proceedings.
</p>
<h4>Present your work at the SMRGSIMT.</h4>

<h2>Exercise 26. A Grand Challenge</h2>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
The Final Challenge for this series of programming exercises is to
create a program which can perform a useful function of Music Technology
(which means <i>the application of technology to music</i>). You are
now well versed in the basic principles of writing well-structured
classes and programmes for handling audio data. The final exercise
is larger-scale than the previous ones, meaning you will have to think
about what you need to accomplish, and specify a collection of classes
and methods which interact with the data to produce a desired result.
</p>

<p>
You will be given a lecture of supporting material, but you will also 
have to do your own research to some extent. You should write up the
outcomes of your project in less than 10 A4 pages including the bibliography
and providing the source code as an appendix.
<span class="texhtml" style="font-family:cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif;">L<span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 70%; margin-left: -0.36em; vertical-align: 0.3em; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.15em;">a</span>T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em;">e</span><span style="margin-left: 0.05em; vertical-align: 0.3ex; line-height: 0">&chi;</span></span>
has been installed on the computers in the lab so that you can format your
work, code, musical extracts etc. beautifully.
</p>

<p>
The choice of problems is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a <em>Phase Vocoder</em> which will double the length of a
speech or music sample without changing its pitch;</li>
<li>Using the <em>Autocorrelation Method</em>, plot the pitch of a piece
of music sampled in a given file against time</li>
<li>Write a <em>Linear Predictive Coding</em> program which given a speech file
and a music file, determines the predictor parameters from the speech and
imposes the formants on the music sample, thus creating a "talking
instrument"</li>
<li>Your own challenge, if agreed in advance with Nick and 
the demonstrator. You'll
need to support its viability with background research.</li>
</ul>

<h4>... Write up and hand in your work. It's worth 2 normal exercises.</h4>
