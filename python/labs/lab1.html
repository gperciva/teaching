<h2>Exercise 1: "Hello, world!" and friends</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
By convention, the first thing to learn in a new programming
language is to print the text "<code>Hello,&nbsp;world!</code>".
Although text isn't very exciting by itself, the ability to
output text is vital for debugging (fixing programs).
</p>

<p>
Most programming languages, including python, indicate text with
"double quotation marks": the first <code>"</code> indicates the
beginning of text.  The computer then treates everything until the
next <code>"</code> as text.
</p>

<p>
This causes problems if you want to print an actual " symbol in
the output.  For that reason, we use <em>escape sequences</em> to
represent symbols which are difficult (or impossible) to indicate
with plain text.
</p>

<p>
In addition to telling a compiler how to create an executable
file, source code should also tell future programmers why the code
does what it does.  If anything in the code is unclear, a
programmer should add <em>comments</em> which explain the
situation.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Printing text (complete example):
</p>

<pre>
print "hello world!"
</pre>

<p>
Selected <em>escape sequences</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Name</th></tr>
  <tr><td>\n</td><td>New line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\t</td><td>Horizontal tab</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\\</td><td>Back slash</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\'</td><td>Single quotation mark</td></tr>
  <tr><td>\"</td><td>Double quotation mark</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Comments:
</p>

<pre>
# this is a comment

print "hello"

# print "this will not be printed"
</pre>

</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Write a short self-introduction (not necessarily truthful!), and a
list of items you would buy if given 1, 10, 100, or 1000 pounds.
Example output:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Greetings!  I am \Sir Percival\ of the Round Table, hailing from
Vancouver, Canada.  My fair city lies approximately 4,500 miles to
the West.  In my country, we say `eh?' a lot.

Free money, you say?  Well, let's see...
        Pounds   Purchase
        1        A packet of tea biscuits.
        10       Second-hand DVDs of "Still Game", so I can learn Glasgow patter.
        100      An external hard drive for my laptop.
        1000     A visit to my family next Christmas.
</pre>

<p>
Your program should:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Print a message similar to the above example.

</li><li>
No line should be longer than 80 characters -- you will need to
use multiple <code>print</code> statements.

</li><li>
Use <em>all</em> these escape sequences: <code>\n \t \\ \'
\"</code>

</li><li>
Use a comment for something.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(optional: make it funny.  We'll like you more.  You won't get any
marks for being funny, but hey, you'll make a friend!  Looking at
these programming exercises gets <em>really</em> boring.)

<h2>Exercise 2: Variables and (simple) Math</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Computers would be boring if they didn't do any computation, and
variables make computation a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
Variables must be <em>declared</em> before you can use them.
Unlike many other programming languages, python does not require
that you specify whether the variable is an integer,
floating-point number, string, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
Variables can be more than one letter long; in fact, this is very
heavily encouraged!  Other than strictly mathematical variables
like <code>t</code> or <code>n</code>, you should almost always
use long variables names.  Use the underscore <code>_</code> to
join multiple words together.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Text variables are called <em>strings</em>, short for "a string of
characters".  Technically, they are stored as an <em>array</em> of
characters, but that detail is not important to us.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

Declaring and printing variables, and basic math:

<pre>
x = 3
print "x is currently", x

y = 4.001
print "y is currently", y
print "Make that shorter: %.1f" % (y)
print "Make that longer: %.8f" % (y)

z = x/y
z = x + z*y - y
print "Why does z = %i ?\n" % (z)

animal_name = "cat"
cute_name = "kitty"
combo = cute_name + animal_name
print "We can do \"math\" on strings: %s" % (combo)

print "We can print multiple",
print "variables: %i %f %i %s\n" % (x, y, z, cute_name)
</pre>

<div class="info">
Examine the above program carefully -- there is a
lot of good information in it!  Try changing the values of
variables, and examine the new output.
</div>

</div>

<br style="clear:both"/>

<div class="task">
<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
Save your introduction/story program from Exercise 1 with a new
file name: we will be modifying it, but you don't want to lose all
your hard work.
</p>

<p>
Modify the new version of your introduction/story so that your program:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Uses variables for all numbers, and at least one string
</li><li>
Use some math to change the value of a variable.
</li><li>
Prints at least one integer
</li><li>
Prints at least one float
</li><li>
Prints at least one string
</li><li>
You may not use any numbers within the "double-quotes" of a
<code>print</code> statement -- use variable substitution 

</li>
</ul>

<p>
(hint: converting units is an easy way to get some math in there.
Change between miles / km, pounds / euros, pounds / kg, human
years / cat years, etc.  You may need to rewrite part of your
self-introduction to introduce some units.)
</p>

<div class="info">
Think about your variable names.  Don't write something like:

<pre>
d = d * 1.609344
</pre>

Instead, give them more descriptive names, like

<pre>
distance_km = distance_miles * 1.609344
</pre>

</div>


<br>

<p>
(optional: invent a new measurement (like "centi-flipsies") and
convert into them.)

<h2>Exercise 3: Keyboard input</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Programs would be pretty boring without user interaction.  The
easiest way to get information from the user is with the keyboard.
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Reading strings:
</p>

<pre>
print "Enter an animal name:"
animal_name = raw_input()
print "You typed: %s" % (animal_name)
</pre>

<p>
Reading numbers is slightly more complicated; you need to change
the string into an integer or float.
</p>

<pre>
print "Enter your age (as an integer):"
user_input = raw_input()
age = int(user_input)

print "Enter a float:"
user_input = raw_input()
weight = float(user_input)

print "You typed: %i, %f" % (age, weight)
</pre>

<div class="info">
If the user types something other than an int/float, you'll get an
error.  For now, don't worry about those.

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
<em>Mad libs</em> (similar to "ad-lib") is a popular party game in
North America.  Somebody writes a story, but removes a few nouns,
adjectives, and verbs.  Other people must supply words to replace
them (often with a clue, such as "an animal name" or "a movement
verb"), without knowing the context in which they would be used.
The result is nonsensical and sometimes funny.  For example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
One day, a ________________ went to _______ and _____________ a ______.
            name of animal           place       verb (past)     noun

(other people supply: "polar bear", "Russia", "ate", and "house".)
</pre>

<p>
Write a program which implements a mad-lib game:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Unlike traditional mad-libs, your story must use numeric values
(e.g., "price in pounds, number of people") in addition to text.

</li><li>
Use at least one integer, one float, and one string.  The variable
names must provide clues about their function, i.e.

<pre>
animal_name
time_minutes
</pre>

</li><li>
Ask the user to supply values for these variables.

</li><li>
Read the values from the keyboard input.

</li><li>
Convert at least one numeric variable into a different value.

</li><li>
Print out a madlib (including numeric values).

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
(optional: make it funny)

<a name="functions">
<h2>Exercise 4: Functions</h2>

<div class="left">
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
You are familiar with functions in mathematics -- you've handled
functions like g(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;x^2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2x&nbsp;-&nbsp;3.
In this case, the function <em>returns</em> a value.  The returned
value is computed based on the input.  You have also seen
functions with multiple inputs:
h(x,y)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5x&nbsp;-&nbsp;6x&nbsp;+&nbsp;x*y.
</p>

<p>
We use functions like this in programming.  We need to specify the
number of input variables, do the math, then return the answer.
</p>

<p>
We also sometimes use functions which do not return any values --
these are useful if we want to repeat a few commands, or simply
for program organization.
</p>

<div class="info">
Functions must be declared before ("higher in the <code>.py</code>
file") they are used.
</div>

<br>

<p>
Note that each function has its own <em>scope</em> of variables.
In fact, you can re-use the same variable name in different
functions!
</p>

</div>

<div class="right">
<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
Simple function.  Note that functions must be indented with 4
spaces or a tab!
</p>

<pre>
def g(x):
    return x*x + 2*x - 3

a = 3.2
b = g(a)
print "g(%f) = %f" % (a, b)
print "g(5) = %f" % (g(5))
</pre>

<div class="info">
Note the different variables names in the above example!
</div>

<p>
Various functions:
</p>

<pre>
def cat_years(human_years):
    y = human_years / 7.0
    rounded_y = int(round(y))
    return rounded_y

def sum_of_squares(a, b):
    return a*a + b*b

def p(years, c, animal):
    print "If I were a %s, I'd be" % (animal),
    print "%i years old.\n" % (years)
    print "The sum of squares",
    print "was %f units.\n" % (c)

my_age = 18
x = 3.3
animal = "cat"

years_a = cat_years(my_age)
sum = sum_of_squares(x, 7.4)

p(years_a, sum, animal)

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
As electrical engineering students, you are familiar with Ohm's
Law (<em>V&nbsp;=&nbsp;IR</em>) and calculating the value of
resistors in series (<em>R&nbsp;=&nbsp;R1+R2</em>) and parallel
(<em>1/R&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/R1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/R2</em>).  Consider the
following circuit:
</p>

<div class="centeredImage">
<img src="resistors.png" width=80%>
</div>

<p>
Write a program to calculate the overall current in this circuit.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You <em>must</em> use 3 functions: <code>ohm_law(...)</code>,
<code>series(...)</code>, and <code>parallel(...)</code>.  A 4th
function <code>parallel_three(...)</code> is optional.  Do not
write functions like <code>sum_r1_r2(...)</code>.

</li><li>
Calculate the current for:

<pre>
r1=100; r2=200; r3=300; r4=400; r5=500; r6=600; r7=700;
</pre>

<p>
(you may copy&paste this into your <code>.py</code> file)
<p>

<p>
The answer should be 124.6 mA.
</p>

</li><li>
Calculate the current for:

<pre>
r1=123; r2=234; r3=345; r4=456; r5=567; r6=678; r7=789;
</pre>

<p>
The answer should be 107.6 mA.
</p>

</li><li>
You may find it helpful to use intermediate variables, and to
print debugging information.

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
(optional: you can call functions as inputs to other functions,
i.e.

<pre>
z = f( g(x,y), h(x,y) );
</pre>

Using this, calculate the current from voltage and Rx values in a
single line.)
