<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Filters change the statistics of a signal.
</p>

<p>
In engineering, we usually assume systems are linear.
We go to great lenths to linearise the response of electronic
systems, and non-linear systems are still very much
regarded as "specialist" compared with LTI (Linear, Time-Invariant)
ones. Usually, when we refer to a filter, we mean a device which
changes the spectral characteristics of a presented signal.
</p>

<p>
This lab falls into two parts: designing and implementing a filter
directly by placing poles and zeros on the <i>z</i>-plane, and then
converting a classical, continuous-time design such as the
maximally-flat Butterworth or maximally-steep Tchebychev filters
to operate as a sampled system.
</p>

<p>
First of all, though, we'll need some tools to measure the response
of the systems we build. This can be done in the <em>frequency</em>
domain by taking the Fourier Tranform of filtered white noise,
or in the <em>time</em> domain by passing a varying-frequency
sine-wave ("chirp") through the filter and seeing how its amplitude
changes as the freqency sweeps across the frequency range of interest.

<h3>Maths homework</h3>

<p>
On paper, write out the values for a second-order filter, at the
output of each delay and the output of the entire filter.
Use the coefficients from the <a href="lab6.html#ex16homework">Exercise 16

<h3>Your task...</h3>

<p>
There are a few sub-tasks.  Do them in order, and it would be good
to get them checked by Nick or Graham at each step.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Noise generation: filters aren't so fascinating on a sine wave, so
make a class that generates white noise.  This is like your
sine-wave oscillator classes, but instead of returning an array of
the next 2048 samples of a sine wave, you return 2048 samples of
random values.
<br>
<br>
for fun: after doing white noise, make some other colors of noise,
like pink, brown, grey, blue, violet, orange, or black noise.
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise">wikipedia:
colros of noise</a>)
</li><li>
write a Delay class.  This class will contain a
<code>process(audio_buffer)</code> function, which will output the
input shifted by N samples.  N should be passed in via the
constructor.  You will need an internal buffer of size N to store
values between each function call.
</li><li>
write a Filter class.  For now, you may hard-code the filter
coefficients in the <code>__init__()</code> function (i.e. you do
not need to pass them as arguments).
<br><br>
coefficients will be given out in class.
</li>
</ul>
